    "\n",
    "\"Heart disease” refers to several types of heart conditions that can affect the operations of the heart muscle. These can include; blood vessel disease, coronary artery disease, Heart rhythm problems, congenital heart defects, heart valve disease, disease of the heart muscle and heart infection. The most common of these is coronary artery disease, which affects the blood flow to the heart that can result in heart attacks and heart failure. Heart disease is a leading cause of death for men, women or most racial and ethnics groups around the world. One person dies every 36 seconds in the USA from a cardiovascular disease. Risk of heart disease can be influenced by many factors including, age, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol levels. Growing older increases your risk of damaged and narrowed arteries and a weakened or thickened heart muscle, therefore, individuals older in age are more likely to have heart disease. High blood cholesterol can increase the risk of plaque formation and atherosclerosis and in turn increase the likelihood of heart disease in an individual. Moreover, uncontrolled high blood pressure can result in hardening and thickening of your arteries, narrowing the vessels through which blood flows, increasing an individual's likelihood of having heart disease. Additionally, important symptoms to notice in individuals who have heart disease are the type of chest pain they are having, as angina is chest pain or discomfort caused when your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood(feels like pressure or squeezing in your chest) and is a major symptom of heart disease. Furthermore, angina chest pain along with irregular heartbeats in an individual can strongly indicate that they might have heart disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to age, high blood pressure, high cholesterol being major risk factors of heart disease and the type of chest pain along with irregular heart beats being an important symptom of heart disease we decided that these factors would best predict the presence of heart disease in an individual. Our question is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can we use the age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, type of chest pain and heart rate of an individual to predict whether or not they have heart disease?**\n",
    " \n",
    "This dataset shows information about several individuals that could contribute to heart disease, like blood pressure, chest pain, age, sex, blood sugar, heart rate, e.t.c, and whether or not they have heart disease. The goal of this database is to determine the presence of heart disease in a patient. This goal is represented by the POHD field, which refers to the presence of heart disease in an individual. It is an integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with this database have focused on distinguishing presence of heart disease (a value from 1 through 4) from absence (0). In this database, sex is represented by integer values, with 0 representing female and 1 representing male. The serum_cholestoral field represents serum cholesterol in mg/dl. The chest_pain_type field is represented by integer values ranging from 1-4. A value of 1 indicates typical angina, 2 is atypical angina, 3 is non-anginal pain, and 4 is asymptomatic. \n"

    "**Visualization of Analysis**\n",

    "After predicting and analyzing our data, we now have our confusion matrix, which shows us the number of correctly predicted classifications per type. This confusion matrix is theoretically a visualization method that tells us our accuracy and resulting answer, but it is an ineffective visualization method that has hard for humans to discern and understand, and difficult to manipulate as data seeing as it is not a tidy dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code is a written function that produces and wrangles the prediction data in such a way, that it returns two tidy dataframes with data within those dataframes being nearly identical to the data shown within the confusion matrix, albeit in a more understandable manner. The function called measurement_func, is a created function that takes in the dataframe that has the .pred column binded to it and compares the .pred column with the actual result column. It takes each element within the .pred vector and directly compares it through the usage of an if-else statement in order to generate a new vector with the result of that prediction. If the prediction matches the correct classification, we add a \"Correct\" character to the newly generated vector. We keep doing this as it goes down the result column while sorting by Negative and Postive. For example, if the correct result is \"N\" signifying \"Negative\" and the model predicted \"N\", then we add a new value of \"Correct\" to the new vector for negative values. If the model predicted \"P\" while the correct result is \"N\", then we would add a \"Incorrect\" value to the negative vector. Same goes for \"P\" signifying \"Positive\": if the correct result is \"P\" and the model predicted \"P\", we would add a \"Correct\" value to the new vector for positive values, an incorrect prediction of \"N\" would result in the addition of a \"Incorrect\" value.\n",
    "\n",
    "While all this is going on, we also have an accumulator/counter that is creating a vector of numbers starting at 1, and increasing by 1 till the total number of \"N\" and \"P\" values. This is going to be called the index vector which will be helpful when we graph or look at the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we combine the resulting vectors into two different dataframes: one for P results and one for N results and add the dataframes to a list which we return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the returned dataframes, which are already tidy, we can easily produce a simple and clear visualization that is much easier to understand than the previous confusion matrix. This step to create the function is important because it now makes our code reproducable which is very important for data analysis. Another method that we thought of for making a visualization would have been to manually graph the values produced by the confusion matrix, but the resulting graph would not have been accurate if we change the data split or if we change the seed."

The graph on the left are all the Negative classifications from the Presence_of_heart_Disease column and the right graph represents all the Positive classifications. The plotted value on the x-axis are the two validity outcomes: correctly predicted and incorrectly predicted. They are measured using the y-axis of count meaning how many correctly and how many incorrectly predicted outcomes. The left graph plots the number of correct and incorrect negative predictions: if the model predicts \"N\" and the actual result is \"N\" and when the model predicts \"P\" and the actual result is \"N\" respectively. The right graph is the same with positive predictions: if the model predicts \"P\" and the actual result is \"P\" results in one correct outcome and if the model predicts 'N\" and the actualy result is \"P\" results in one incorrect outcome. \n",

    "We decided to graph the negative vs positive results seperately due to the fact that in this data analysis field, medical diagnosis, predicting correct results when the diagnosis is postivie is much more important than predicting correct results when the diagnosis is negative. It is important to seperate the data to see clearly how well our analysis model is doing on each result. The graphs produced make it quite clear that our model works much better when predicting positive results then when predicting negative results which is a good thing. When the actual result was positive, our model predicted 116 counts correctly and only 22 counts incorrectly resulting in a accuracy of around 85%. When comparing to predicting negative results, we had our model predict 83 correct results and 28 incorrect results which means for negative diagnosis', we had an accuracy of 75%. \n",

    "This is great seeing as we have 10% more accurate positive predictions and that is a huge difference since predicting wrong on a negative diagnosis results in a check-up and possible spending of money, but no mortal or fatal outcomes. Whereas if we predict wrong on a positive diagnosis, the patient would not recieve follow-up treatment which could result in disastrous outcomes and terrible medical hinderences. \n",

    "Despite the fact that our model performs better on positive diagnosis' when compared to negative, it is still not completely accurate when predicting heart disease. Further follow up from a docter is required if in some case our model is used in the medical field as a early warning for heart disease. When doing classification in the medical field, it is important to have as high of an accuracy as possible, nearing 100%, in order to ensure proper treatment is distributed and the right medical personel are contacted."
