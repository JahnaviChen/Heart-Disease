    "\n",
    "\"Heart disease‚Äù refers to several types of heart conditions that can affect the operations of the heart muscle. The most common of these is coronary artery disease, which affects the blood flow to the heart that can result in heart attacks and heart failure. Risk of heart disease can be influenced by many factors. Growing older increases the risk of damaged and narrowed arteries and a weakened or thickened heart muscle, therefore, individuals older in age are more likely to have heart disease. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can result in hardening and thickening of your arteries, narrowing blood vessels, increasing an individual's likelihood of having heart disease. Angina is chest pain caused when your heart doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. Angina chest pain can indicate presence of heart disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "High blood pressure, chest pain, and high cholesterol are major warning signs for heart disease, so we decided that these factors would best predict the presence of heart disease in an individual. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our question is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can we use the age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, type of chest pain and heart rate of an individual to predict whether or not they have heart disease?**\n",
    " \n",
    "This dataset shows information about several individuals that could contribute to heart disease and whether or not they have heart disease. The goal of this database is to determine the presence of heart disease in a patient. This goal is represented by the POHD field, which refers to the presence of heart disease in an individual. It is an integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with this database have focused on distinguishing presence of heart disease (a value from 1 through 4) from absence (0). In this database, sex is represented by integer values, with 0 representing female and 1 representing male. The serum_cholestoral field represents serum cholesterol in mg/dl. The chest_pain_type field is represented by integer values ranging from 1-4. A value of 1 indicates typical angina, 2 is atypical angina, 3 is non-anginal pain, and 4 is asymptomatic. \n"

The plotted value on the x-axis are the two validity outcomes: correctly predicted and incorrectly predicted. They are measured using the y-axis of count meaning how many correctly and how many incorrectly predicted outcomes. The left graph plots the number of  negative predictions: if the model predicts \"N\", it is correct. If predicted \"P\" it is incorrect. The right graph is the same with positive predictions: if the model predicts \"P\" it is correct, predicting \"N\" results an incorrect outcome. \n",

    "We decided to graph the negative vs positive results seperately because predicting correctly when the diagnosis is positive is much more important than predicting correctly when the diagnosis is negative. The seperated graphs make it clear that our model works better when predicting positive results. When the actual result was positive, our model predicted 116 counts correctly and only 22 counts incorrectly resulting in a accuracy of around 85%. When comparing to predicting negative results, we had our model predict 83 correct results and 28 incorrect results which means for negative diagnosis', we had an accuracy of 75%. \n",

    "Through our model we were able to determine that if you use age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, type of chest pain and heart rate of an individual, you can predict the presence of heart disease with around 80 percent accuracy. This accuracy enables us to determine the presence of heart disease using these variables, however, in the context of this data, this accuracy is not reliable enough to be a practical determinor. Accuracy should be better than 80%, because it can be a life or death diagnosis. None of these predictors are sure signs that an individual has heart disease. The final analysis matched what we predicted: we can use these variables to predict whether or not an individual has heart disease at a decently high accuracy rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "These findings could serve as a preliminary testing process. If the model predicts that someone has heart disease, it would be very beneficial to quickly get that individual more testing to determine for sure whether or not they have heart disease, however a negative prediction from the model should not alleviate all concern. \n",
    "\n",
    "This could lead to future questions about how to improve the model. Could we build a model that rated how likely a person was to have heart disease, providing a way to decide who needed help most urgently? Are there other predictors that could more accurately determine presence of heart disease? \n"
